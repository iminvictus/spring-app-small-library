# My first Spring MVC app

Simple Spring JDBC app that is some sort of digital library. 
You can add people from /people/new and so is for the books books/new, edit them, assign books to people and release them from book owning.
SQL queries for creating and filling tables are in `main/sql`

## Guideline

To run the app, clone this repository and add Tomcat 9 configuration in IDEA/Eclipse.
Run your Database locally or remote and set the connection parameters in `database.propeties`, then run the app.
